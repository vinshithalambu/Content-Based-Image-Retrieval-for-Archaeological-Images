# Content-Based Image Retrieval for Archaeological Images

This project implements a Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) system using deep learning techniques on an archaeological image dataset.

## Overview
The system retrieves visually similar archaeological artifacts based on image content such as shape, texture, and structural patterns instead of text-based metadata.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Deep Learning (CNN)
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Application
- Cultural heritage analysis
- Digital archaeology
- Artifact similarity search
